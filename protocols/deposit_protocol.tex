    \textbf{Depositing to rollup}
\end{center}
\smallbreak
In order to transact on the rollup, users must have a token balance on the rollup. To have such a balance, the user can either receive funds from another L2 user or deposit the funds themselves. We now describe the setting where Alice performs her own deposit of funds. To do so, user Alice performs the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0.25em}

    \item Alice creates a deposit block containing the destination L2 address and the amount of each token to be deposited. 

    \item Alice submits the deposit block to the rollup smart contract together with the specified amount of each token. 
\end{itemize}


In this step, the destination L2 address does not necessarily have to belong to Alice, as she may be attempting to deposit funds into someone else's account.
