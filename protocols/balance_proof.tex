\textbf{Prove Balance}\\
To prove that there is a certain balance in a specific account, user Alice performs the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Alice, every time she sends a transaction keeps a proof of inclusion of specific transaction in a set of transactions. This set of transactions is stored in the form of a merkle tree and the corresponding root is signed by each sender involved in the set of transactions. 

\item Alice calculates a recursive zero-knowledge proof of her account balance. 

% \item Alice sends the zero knowledge proof to the recipient offchain, who will verify



\end{enumerate}
