We presented Intmax2, a novel ZK-rollup approach that completely shifts away from traditional ZK-rollup approaches. By leveraging the fact that aggregators do not need to perform computationally intensive zero-knowledge proofs, and instead moving the computation is on the side of the users in the system, our design provides a novel, practical, and resilient solution to L2 scaling. In contrast with previous approaches, our solution does not require the posting of all transaction data on the underlying L1, and provides better liveness guarantees. On a final note, we highlight that unlike the majority of the deployed ZK-rollups platforms, our design allows for a much simpler path to the decentralization of the aggregator role, thus addressing one of the main existing problems in the rollup space.
