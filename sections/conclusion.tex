We presented Intmax2, a novel ZK-rollup approach that completely
shifts away from traditional ZK-rollup approaches. In contrast with
previous approaches, our solution does not require the posting of all
transaction data on the underlying L1, which enables unprecedented
scalability. By leveraging the fact that aggregators do not need to
perform computationally intensive zero-knowledge proofs, and instead
moving the computation on the side of the users in the system, our
design provides a novel, practical, and resilient solution to L2
scaling. On a final note, by making the aggregator role completely
permissionless, our design allows for a much more
censorship-resistant solution, thus addressing one of the main
existing problems in the rollup space.
