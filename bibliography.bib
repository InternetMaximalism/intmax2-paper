	re needed. All our constructions support both signature compression and
	public-key aggregation. Hence, to verify that a number of parties signed
	a common message m, the verifier only needs a short multi-signature, a
	short aggregation of their public keys, and the message m. We give new c
	onstructions that are derived from Schnorr signatures and from BLS signa
	tures. Our constructions are in the plain public key model, meaning that
	users do not need to prove knowledge or possession of their secret key.

	definitions of a sparse Merkle tree and related operations. We show tha

	A-512/256. This is despite a limited amount of space for the cache---sma

Lean 4 is fully extensible: users can modify and extend the parser, elaborator, tactics, decision procedures, pretty printer, and code generator. The new system has a hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. It contains a new typeclass resolution procedure based on tabled resolution, addressing significant performance problems reported by the growing user base. Lean 4 is also an efficient functional programming language based on a novel programming paradigm called functional but in-place. Efficient code generation is crucial for Lean users because many write custom proof automation procedures in Lean itself.},
